PythonHelpers
=============

A set of python helpers that help you developing python applications:

- datacache.py: Cache your data using Redis or memcached (datacache.py)
- postgresqlmodel.py : Easy wrapper for psycopg2 based on CodeIgniter models. A parser from python data structure to SQL, it allows to insert data in a postgresql without writting SQL in a secure way, just give a dictionary (or an array of dictionaries) and the table where the data will be added to.

For more information take a look at samples folder.
